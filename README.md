# Prediction Live Extension

A Chrome extension enabling real-time prediction challenges for Twitch esports streams using Fan Tokens.

## The Problem It Solves

### Seamless Twitch Integration
- Make predictions directly on Twitch without leaving the platform
- Avoids streaming rights issues by not rebroadcasting content

### Secure and Fair Predictions
- Short, real-time predictions (e.g., "Who will score next?") reduce match manipulation risk
- No new collusion risks beyond existing esports protocols

### Real Utility for Fan Tokens
- Transforms Fan Tokens from collectibles into interactive tools
- Team performance directly influences token demand
- No arbitrary limitations or penalties for high engagement

## How It Works

During esports matches, users can participate in real-time predictions:

1. A prediction appears (e.g., "Which team will secure the next Baron?")
2. Users vote using team-specific Fan Tokens
3. When the outcome is determined, losing tokens are swapped to winning team tokens
4. This creates buying pressure on successful teams' tokens, making prices reflect performance
